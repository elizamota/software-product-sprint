        I was not introduced to Computer Science until my freshman year of college when I took an Introductory coding class because it was 
        a prerequisite for the math major that I was pursuing at the time. As we tackled different 
        aspects of new material, I realized that I enjoyed coding more than my other classes. I had 
        never before pictured myself as a software developer but in learning to code, I realized how much I 
        loved it. This summer I had two internships that helped me both develop my technical skills and gain 
        exposure to this field. I interned for Grand Valley Metro Council where I contributed to their Adopt a Drain
        project databases written in Python. This opportunity allowed me to see what coding is like in a real 
        life setting. I also interned for Grand Circus where I assisted intro to coding classes in javascript. I was 
        introduced to a new language and able to expose residents in my city to a skill that I am passionate about. 
        I also took a day long workshop on CSS and HTML with Grand Circus where I gained exposure to front-end coding. 
        In all of these different experiences, I am working to make my Computer Science knowledge as well rounded as possible.
